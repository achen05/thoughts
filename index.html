    This is naked communication. This is learning to address no one, made clear, explicit even. This website has no CSS, no Javascript, it doesn't even use any HTML tags other than the bare neccesities for browsers to read the file as HTML. No not even line breaks.
    This website houses my (Aldon Chen) unfiltered, unedited thoughts, or at least everything I bother to write down somewhere, and makes them public. I used to keep all of them on my iPhone Notes app, but, for the sake of experimentation in aesthetics and language, I've decided to make this project public.
    So why 'nakedness?' What does 'naked' communication mean in the context of this project?
    Well are you tired of everything screaming at you? I mean like advertisments, visual culture, the aesthetic paradigm of the 21st century where eveything has to be made loud because most of us are suffering from a widespread attention deficiency, a symptom of a society hellbent on consumption. Well actually I don't care whether you do or do not, this is my website and I'm tired of the aesthetic paradigm.
    First, I have to explain the history of the GUI and the rise of visual communcation design (graphic design) as a commercial asset. But honestly I don't feel like it right now so maybe you'll get to read about that later on this page when I do decide to write it. Oops I just had to fix a typo,
    there's going to be a lot of typos on this page. like *a lot* but I also don't want people to think I don't know how to spell things or how to differentiaite between things like 'there,' 'their,' and 'they're,' so I guess that's somehwart filtered.
    And before someone contacts me saying that HTML is still built upon many, many layers of abstraction; Yes, I am aware, I took comp sci 101 too. The goal of this project is not to push the boundries of computational theory or some point at some ontological truth about engineering or whatever.
    I'm a graphic designer, it's a experiment in aesthetics and language, in response to post-structuralist ideas about language.
    There's no CSS on this page, the browser uses your default browser/system font to render the text you are reading, I'm giving that power to you, the reader, to typeset this website on your own terms because if I were to myself, I would be communicating to you with an additional layer of abstraction. One which is, arguably, unnecessary. I hope I spelled that correctly, I'm writing all of this on Atom, which doesn't spell check.
    I think whenever I return to write more on this website, I might continue to revist older text and edit them. Is that a form of filteration? I guess it is. Well I guess I'm filtering it then as it seems necessary to clarfiy my thoughts.
    Eventually, this website will have full (or fuller) ideas sprinkled throughout, I hope at least. Writing all of this in a text editor designed for code is going to make this a very special hell on its own. I wanted to write a Svelte JS website for this where I can fetch data from the Google Sheets API or something like that in order to give myself an interface to update this site on without the need of my computer but I decided
    not to do that because I figured that using a JS framework would 1) add a layer of abstraction, and I guess that's the only reason.
    At some point there's going to be so much text on this page that I don't think I could sift through everything for errors, so that's that.
    There's a really real fear that one day I might write something that is politically, socially, or otherwise ethically problematic, but I truly don't think there is anyone that cares enough about my thoughts to read through everything. If there is though, we should be friends. But even if there isn't, we could still be friends.
    In the case that I ever do write something problematic and I get ostracized for it, I think such an event would says less about me and more about a culture willing to cannibalize its members for what is essentially an uncontrollable spew of ideas, the workings of an idle mind which is perhaps our only known truth.
    Is that where this project is going? An insufferably long page of vaguely stylized prose trying to pass off as poetic or profound? Honestly, maybe. If it does seem like that at times, consider me a poet.
    What about cringe though? Or cringey things? Honestly, if there's a person out there who's mind doesn't to some degree, produce cringey thoughts and unconsciously forces a person to articulate them, then I think there's a greater discussion to be had about human nature that I am truly not qualified to discuss. In the meantime, while cringe is still considered a fundamental part of our humanity, I'd suggest a therapist.
