    This is naked communication. This website has no CSS, no Javascript, it doesn't even use any HTML tags other than the bare neccesities for browsers to read the file as HTML. No not even line breaks.
    This website houses my (Aldon Chen) unfiltered, unedited thoughts, or at least everything I bother to write down somewhere, and makes them public. I used to keep all of them on my iPhone Notes app, but, for the sake of experimentation in aesthetics and language, I've decided to make this project public.
    So why 'nakedness?' What does 'naked' communication mean in the context of this project?
    First, I have to explain the history of the GUI and the rise of visual communcation design (graphic design) as a commercial asset. But honestly I don't feel like it right now so maybe you'll get to read about that later on this page when I do decide to write it. Oops I just had to fix a typo,
    there's going to be a lot of typos on this page. like *a lot* but I also don't want people to think I don't know how to spell things or how to differentiaite between things like 'there,' 'their,' and 'they're,' so I guess that's somehwart filtered.
    And before someone contacts me saying that HTML is still built upon many, many layers of abstraction; Yes, I am aware, I took comp sci 101 too. The goal of this project is not to push the boundries of computational theory or some point at some ontological truth about engineering or whatever.
    I'm a graphic designer, it's a experiment in aestehtics and lanaguage, in response to post-structuralist ideas about language.
