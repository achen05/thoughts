    This is naked communication. This website has no CSS, no Javascript, it doesn't even use any HTML tags other than the bare neccesities for browsers to read the file as HTML. No not even line breaks.
    This website houses my (Aldon Chen) unfiltered, unedited thoughts, or at least everything I bother to write down somewhere, and makes them public. I used to keep of them on my iPhone Notes app, but, for the sake of experimentation in aesthetics and language, I've decided to make this project public.
